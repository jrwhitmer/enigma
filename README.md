# enigma self evaluation

- For functionality I would give myself a 3 because my Enigma class runs encrypt and decrypt methods and my CLI works

- For OOP I would give myself a 2.75, as there is a small amount of functionality that I believe I could have outsourced in enigma but did not get to implementing. Otherwise, I have classes with individual responsibilities that are of appropriate length and talk to each other well.

- For Ruby Convention, I would give myself a 3.25 because my lines are well spaced and indented, and methods have helpers and are readable and not too long. But there are two methods that exceed 10 lines (encrypt and decrypt). I believe I chose the appropriate enumerables in most if not all of my code, and I can speak as to why I chose them. I used a hash for shifting and unshifting my text in a way that made logical sense, to me.

- For TDD, I would give myself a 3.5, most of my methods are tested, I use stubs throughout my testing for randomness, but not all of my tests run without depending on other classes functionality (which I like better because then I can tell if I really really break something, but that's just me). I write all of my tests before the methods they are testing, and my coverage is 100%.
